Long COVID can affect anyone – children and adults, otherwise healthy people and those with other health conditions. It’s been seen in those who’ve been hospitalized and those with very mild symptoms.

As of July 2021, long COVID has been classified as a disability under the federal Americans and Disability Act, but there are still many questions about the condition.

As researchers continue to try to piece together the mysteries surrounding long COVID, Bethany Bruzzi, DO, chief medical officer at Banner – University Medical Center Tucson, answered questions about what we know, including symptoms and treatment.

What is long COVID?
“An individual with long COVID has symptoms that persist, relapse or reoccur for more than 30 days after first being infected by the COVID-19 virus following recovery from the initial illness,” Dr. Bruzzi said.

Studies show 25% to 30% of people who recover from COVID-19 will deal with lingering symptoms. Some of these symptoms include:

Flu-like symptoms
Brain fog (difficulty thinking or concentrating)
Chest pain
Stomach pain/issues
Trouble sleeping
Weight loss
Dizziness when standing
Mood changes
Continued respiratory symptoms
Continued loss of taste and smell
Why do people experience long COVID differently?
A challenging part of long COVID is that symptoms, and how severe they are, can vary widely from person to person.

“Because the COVID-19 virus affects all organ systems, so many different symptoms can arise both during the initial infection and as a long COVID infection,” Dr. Bruzzi said. “How your immune system is disrupted can also vary between individuals. Having a history of chronic illness may make one organ system more susceptible than another.”

Are some people more susceptible to long COVID than others?
Anyone who has had COVID-19 can get long COVID, regardless of their age or prior health conditions. However, a recent study suggested that older adults, women, those with a history of asthma and those with particular immune markers (proteins in our body that determine how well we can fight harmful infections) were more likely to experience long COVID.

“However, research continues in this area,” Dr. Bruzzi said. “Although the immune system is certainly an area of focus for investigators at this time, there are no current recommendations for blood tests that would help determine an immune system connection, and specific immune markers would not be used to confirm a long COVID diagnosis.”

Can vaccinations protect against long COVID?
Those who are up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination are less likely to have severe illness or become hospitalized from the initial infection. Having your vaccination could also help protect against long COVID.

“Although anyone can experience long COVID syndrome, it is more likely for an individual who has experienced severe disease,” Dr. Bruzzi said. “A recent study found people were more at risk for long COVID when they experienced five or more symptoms during their initial infection.”

How long will it take for me to recover from long COVID?
It is currently unclear how long recovery from long COVID may take. “Since there is no pill or one specific treatment to treat long COVID, recovery times may be different for each person,” Dr. Bruzzi said. “Much of the current treatment is determined based on the symptoms experienced.”

Does exercise help or hurt long COVID?
“Exercise can always help patients,” Dr. Bruzzi said.

Considering exercise is known to improve heart conditions, lung conditions and improve mental health, it should always be considered as treatment for ongoing illness. However, as with any illness or condition, Bruzzi noted the importance of discussing with your health care provider before jumping into an exercise routine.",1680110214211Top questions doctors are getting about long covid.jpg,Long COVID: Post-COVID Syndrome,2023-03-29T17:33:08.239Z,Kimberly Marcelin Nathan
0,64247385ce310cf53fe3a332,[],2023-03-29T17:21:09.360Z,"This post is part of a Health Affairs Blog short series, “Stories of COVID-19.” The series presents first-person accounts from patients and providers that highlight policy issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and response. For longer-form personal essays about health care, read our long-running Narrative Matters series in the journal.

When the United States recorded 100,000 deaths from the novel coronavirus, the New York Times (NYT) commemorated the lives lost by filling their front page with a list of the names of those who died, accompanied by descriptive phrases that gave small glimpses into their lives. Titled “An Incalculable Loss,” the piece helped remind us that those who perished from the virus were people, beloved members of our communities. Like many New Yorkers, I scrolled through the names on the list, trying to understand the scope of loss our city was experiencing. Like many New Yorkers, I came across a name I recognized. This name, however, wasn’t of a friend or family member, it was of one of the patients that I took care of when they got sick with COVID-19.

I work as a hospitalist at a large hospital in Manhattan. During the COVID-19 peak, I was redeployed to co-lead one of the pop-up intensive care units (ICUs) created to expand our ability to care for our sickest patients during the surge. It may not seem surprising that I came across the name of one of my patients on the NYT list, but the odds are actually exceedingly small. Although the article depicted an unimaginable amount of deaths over a few short months, the names represented only 1 percent of the total lives lost in the United States at that time. And while New York City has been the epicenter of the pandemic, Manhattan was relatively spared compared to the other NYC boroughs. And yet, we did not feel spared.

Within three weeks of admitting our first COVID-19 patient, we had filled all our existing ICUs with coronavirus cases and had started construction to create new ICUs to keep up with the number of critically ill patients. As one colleague described, it felt like we were imitating Wile E. Coyote as he frantically tried to lay down new train tracks before an oncoming train; as soon as a new ICU opened, it was filled within hours.

 
The name I came across in the article was one of my first patients in the newly created COVID-19 ICU where I was asked to work. As a hospitalist, I am trained as a doctor of internal medicine who cares for acutely ill hospitalized patients. Although I have worked in ICUs before, I am not critically care trained. Determined to provide my patients with the best care possible, I spent time training with our critical care colleagues, practicing procedures on mannequins, and watching countless videos aimed at brushing up on my ventilation management skills. I was partnered with an anesthesia attending and pulmonary critical care fellow to create a team that brought together different skills to ensure we could handle all aspects of the patients’ care.

Our 12-bed ICU was completely filled within 36 hours of its existence. The patient on the NYT list was one of five new patients with severe COVID-19 who came to us within four hours. We quickly realized that caring for these patients was a hospitalwide team effort. We had daily phone conferences to share our experiences, exchange ideas, and create new standards of care. We all became COVID-19-ists, united in treating just one disease. Yet, in other ways, the care of these patients was also incredibly lonely. I spent my days standing alone in the room of intubated and sedated patients, in layers of personal protective equipment, listening to the beeping of monitors and the hum of the negative pressure system, hoping that we had learned enough about this disease to help our patients survive. I often found my gloved hands holding theirs, knowing that they didn’t know I was there but hoping that my touch might make them, and me, feel less alone. 

I can remember every patient in our unit those first few weeks. The 40-year-old man whose old college friends sent us daily meals for three weeks; the 80-year-old man who had a wife dying of COVID-19 in another hospital; the man who survived discharge from the COVID-19 ICU only to die in a general medicine unit a few days later from a massive bleed; the sole woman being treated in the COVID-19 unit, who used to be a nurse. Some of them passed. Some of them stayed in our unit for weeks, went to our in-house rehabilitation unit, and were eventually discharged home. Some of them are still hospitalized today. And while the stories of all those patients stay with me, the patient whose name I came across in the article is especially meaningful. He was my first patient that died of COVID-19.

The day he died was also the day that my first patient with COVID-19 improved enough to be taken off a ventilator. Our whole team stood in a mass outside of the glass doors, watching as the respiratory therapist prepped to take the breathing tube out. It would be our first time seeing someone with such severe disease survive this infection. As soon as he was extubated, the resident on our team rushed into the room with an iPad to FaceTime the patient’s family. We could hear the cries and cheers of his family from outside. My resident, wanting the family to see the team that took care of their loved one, swung the iPad around and there we were 10 masked faces cheering from just outside the room. Six feet, a glass door, and an iPad apart, we all celebrated that moment together.

But within 10 minutes of this first success, I was standing in the room of my other patient, to be with him when he died. Up until a few days before his death, his story sounded exactly the same as the patient’s we had just extubated. He was a man in his fifties, with a few well-controlled medical problems, who came in with a dry cough and shortness of breath. Both men had been on the medical floor for a few days before they were intubated. Both spent the first few days on our unit deeply sedated, paralyzed, on high ventilatory settings. But for reasons unknown to me, or to the rest of the medical community, one of them was recovering, and the other was progressing to multi-organ failure.

I stood at his bedside in disbelief that we weren’t able to help him survive. He was young, too young. He still looked robust, as if he was about to wake up and tell us to take the tube out. Like all hospitalists, I’ve taken care of many dying patients, but this death felt different. I was not used to seeing a young healthy person die of pneumonia. I was left feeling like I failed him and struggled to give him any semblance of a “good death” in the sterile, lonely ICU room.

My patient’s partner saw him for the last time over FaceTime. Family and friends texted the patient’s phone so we could read their messages aloud before he passed. I was struck by the contrast of his current situation to his last texts where he told people he was feeling fine but the doctors told him he needed to be intubated. We read him messages of love, thanks, and sadness from his family and friends, knowing that it was a poor substitute for their presence but trying to do whatever we could to imitate what a good death would look like in any other situation. I stood in the room with the nurse in silence, not knowing how long it would take for him to pass but not wanting to leave him alone. The nurse suggested it might be nice to play him some music. My goggles fogged up while I tried to find his most played list on Spotify. The music that played was upbeat and electric, completely at odds with his current situation. It made me imagine the type of person he was before he got sick, before COVID-19 took his life. An hour after his death, a new COVID-19 patient on the edge of death rolled into his now disinfected room, forcing us to quickly shift our attention to try to help this new patient survive.

When I saw the deceased patient’s name on the NYT list, feelings of hopelessness and guilt resurfaced once again. There were no proven treatments for COVID-19, so most of the time it felt like everything we were doing was just buying patients time. Buying them time to let their bodies either recover or succumb. We saved a lot of lives by buying them time, but we lost a lot, too. I clicked on his name in the article, and it led me to his obituary. I learned about his life and his passions and got a glimpse into the man who listened to that upbeat playlist. I hoped that our farewell was the good death he deserved.

A few weeks later, I was sent a video of our first extubated patient going home. He was walking out of a car, down the sidewalk, and up the stairs, all with an oxygen canister in tow. He had a big grin on his face as he looked at all his neighbors out on the doorsteps cheering him on. He probably wouldn’t recognize me if we met. He left our ICU almost immediately after he was extubated to make room for the next patient, and he never saw me without my mask and goggles. But seeing him take those steps brought me to tears. I shared the video with my team as a reminder of the meaning behind our work.

It is my colleagues that I worry about now. Every doctor in my hospital has stories like mine: stories of soaring highs and extreme lows. Doctors speak of being unable to do right by patients due to resource limitations or institutional policies. They tell stories of distress over equity in patient care and stories of rage about the societal and governmental response to this crisis. And now, with the rates of COVID-19 rising in the rest of the country, many more doctors will be dealing with these scars and collective trauma. Studies all over the world are finding higher than usual rates of burnout and depressive symptoms amongst doctors caring for COVID-19 patients. In New York, where we are just past the first wave of COVID-19, we are starting to think about how we can heal the healers. 

We have learned that we need to move beyond the impromptu office debriefing with colleagues and create formalized space and time for hospitalists to share and reflect on experiences. Our hospitalist group has started the process by allowing doctors to choose the format in which they would like to debrief. Everyone had the opportunity to meet in dyads, small groups, or large groups, to swap stories, cry through losses, celebrate victories, and vent about the things we had no control over and things that we could have done better. It has let many of us explore emotions that we did not have time to deal with in the moment and may not have even recognized that we were having. It also helped us lean on the people in our lives who truly understood our experience: each other.

Part of this process also included sessions with the hospitalist section chief to reflect as a group on the response to the crisis. Hospitalists were encouraged to have honest and open discussions about what did not work well organizationally, as well as to brainstorm and exchange ideas on how the group could do things differently moving forward. Having a leader at the table who was committed to listening and enacting change was key in combating the helplessness and isolation felt by individual practitioners.

Hospitals must start prioritizing—and devoting time and resources to—the well-being of their providers during the pandemic. Given the degree of trauma experienced by providers, if we don’t address the post-COVID-19 care of physicians now, we will find the consequences of burnout rippling through the medical field. Our community has already seen its first physician suicide amidst this crisis. Beyond the negative impact of burnout on providers, we know that patients’ care will also suffer. As we prepare for a potential second surge of COVID-19 infections, it is imperative that we invest in helping our physicians recover, so they can be prepared to provide the best care possible when they are asked to lead the fight once again.",1680110468784health-affairs-covid-19-stories_blog.png,Stories Of COVID - 19 - Caring For The Caregivers,2023-04-02T18:48:17.465Z,Kimberly Marcelin Nathan

Across the board, everyone’s wellness scores tanked after COVID hit. That happy 66% of the workforce dropped down to 48% both in the US and UK.

This drop was seen across the board, including all genders and rankings. Where we did see nuance, however, is in discussions of out-of-office changes.

How COVID-19 impacted employee wellness
Hibob Research – Covid impacted mental health and wellbeing at work
We asked participants to tell us whether COVID has impacted them physically (ie. their health or the health of a loved one) or economically (their finances or a loved one’s). They responded either:

Health and economic environments unaffected
Health environment unaffected, economic environment affected
Health environment affected, economic environment unaffected
Health and economic environments affected
Health and economic environments unaffected
These respondents seemed to be pretty happy before the pandemic began. 71% of Americans responded that they were doing well or very well at work; 65% of Brits said the same.

Who are the people who came out of COVID physically and financially unscathed? It can be assumed that these are the folks with the most economic security: the ones who can afford the best healthcare and work in industries or roles that weren’t directly impacted by the COVID crisis. Of course their work lives were good: they were well-compensated and taken care of.

Even these people, however, weren’t invincible to COVID’s impact.

At least not the British ones. While the American percentage of happy folks stayed the same, we can see a 12-point drop in the British percentage. Could it be because the British feel more connected to each other and their outside environment? Or because they’re more sensitive to the global climate?

Whatever it is: even the well-off are having a tough go of it in the UK.

Health environment unaffected, economic environment affected
Before the pandemic, these were a happy bunch, with 67% of American respondents and 69% of Brits in this group saying they were doing well or very well.

In both countries, however, these numbers dropped precipitously for those hit by COVID-related economic troubles.

A 20-point drop can’t be ignored. Without financial security, Maslow says, we can’t focus on enjoyment—so employees experiencing financial setbacks (their own or a loved one’s) can’t be expected to work at their maximum.

Health environment affected, economic environment unaffected
Interestingly enough, this group of people was the least severely unhappy in the US before the pandemic, with only 8% rating themselves a 1-2 on the five-point wellness scale. In the UK, 12% rated themselves a 1-2, coming in second only to those whose economic and health environments remained unaffected. 67% of Americans in this category surveyed and 68% of Brits reported feeling great.

After the pandemic, however, things got complicated.

In the US, this formerly high-satisfaction group took a turn for the worst, with 18% of them reporting feeling severely or completely unwell (as opposed to 8% pre-pandemic). In the UK the percentage of low-wellness folks stayed stagnant, but the percentage of high-satisfaction folks dropped by 14%.

While folks in the UK seem to be more impacted by their surroundings, the state of the American healthcare system makes Americans more sensitive to health-related issues. While the Brits are covered in the event of a health-related catastrophe, Americans have a lot more to worry about.

This group suffered the worst of what COVID brought us: both financial and health losses. This group was the weakest before the pandemic, with nearly 15% in both countries reporting extreme dissatisfaction and unwellness and the least of all groups reporting high wellness scores.  

Who’s in this group? Why were their pre-pandemic wellness scores so low?

The folks who are most impacted by illness and loss are the ones most vulnerable to it. The struggles of this group didn’t start with COVID-19; they were around long before.

And yet, somehow COVID made their struggles worse. The percentage of struggling workers reporting extreme dissatisfaction doubled to 27% in both countries, and the percentage reporting high wellbeing scores dropped to under 50%.

While we all have been impacted by COVID, the employees we see suffering the most are the ones who had the hardest time before the pandemic. 

To help all of your people stay mentally and physically healthy, you need to get to know who they are inside and outside of the office. None of us are islands, and it’s enough for a family member or loved one to lose income or get sick for our own performance to be impacted.

Keep a close eye on your people. We’re all a little bit vulnerable right now.

There is significant variation in the duration that it takes people to develop mild symptoms.

The average incubation period of COVID-19 is roughly 3 to 6 days long in people with mild / moderate / critical / severe infection. Generally observed 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus.

In asymptomatic case there are no symptoms to count the period.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), most of the laboratory confirmed patients (around 75% to 80%) have had mild to moderate infection, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 13.8% have severe disease (dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥30/minute, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours) and 6.1% are critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure) or completely asymptomatic (not having any symptoms). An infected person with COVID-19 can experience a wide range of symptoms, often including a dry cough and shortness of breath.

When the virus does cause -

most common symptoms include fever, sore throat, coughing, tiredness or fatigue, loss of taste or smell.
less common symptoms include headache, diarrhea, rashes on the skin, aches and pains, red or irritated eyes.
In some people, COVID-19 causes more severe symptoms include shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and loss of speech or mobility, new confusion, chest pain that require immediate medical attention.

People critically affected with COVID-19 and having severe symptoms will require treatment and care at hospital.

As per current data after 5 days of the mild infections, slowly the symptoms are becoming worse, to cope up with it immune system produces antibodies to fight the virus. Resulting fluctuations in blood oxygen level (Spo2), increase in fever, bad respiratory symptoms, heaviness, etc making it necessary to monitor the day by day symptoms at regular intervals to recover fast from coronavirus.",16805454111796a62c511-7578-4ec3-8d74-66657d17564f.jpg,Incubation period of COVID-19,2023-04-03T18:10:12.213Z,Jim Gilmour

There is no particular pattern in the order of symptom development. Some people will start with a cough; others will develop fever, with cough arriving only a few days late to develop hypoxia or dyspnea stage. Among patients, exhaustion and aching all over appear to be common early signs.

As per the update and case studies published in September, explained that the rise in coronavirus infection and frequency due to asymptomatic people, this is the main reasons why Covid-19 turned from an epidemic (concentrated in one area) to a pandemic (a global spread).

0,642b195648db562e66543ea5,[],2023-04-03T18:22:14.408Z,"The world’s biggest vaccine manufacturer is the Serum Institute of India. Roger Highfield, Science Director, talks to Umesh Shaligram, Executive Director, about its vast COVID-19 vaccination effort.

The Serum Institute of India is now the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by number of doses produced and sold globally (more than 1.5 billion doses per annum) which includes Polio vaccine as well as Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type B, BCG, Hepatitis B, Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccines.

Two thirds of children on the planet receive at least one vaccine manufactured by the institute, the country’s largest biotech company, and its vaccines are used in around 170 nations.

Inequality of health care was the driving force behind the creation of the Serum Institute; it grew out of the conviction of Dr Cyrus Poonawalla, now its Chair, that millions of poor children across India and Africa were dying of preventable diseases.

He founded the institute on his horse farm more than half a century ago. Much of the demand comes from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the public-private partnership founded in 2000 with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to help buy vaccines in bulk for poor countries.

As India experiences a major surge in infections, I talked to Umesh Shaligram, Executive Director, about how the Serum Institute of India committed to produce 1 billion doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine for low- and middle-income countries, including India itself, and another billion doses of Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine.

His edited answers are in italics.

WHERE DO YOU MAKE ALL YOUR VACCINES?
We are based in Pune, Maharashtra, India, which is 200 kilometres southeast of Bombay. We have two main sites where we manufacture over here in Hadapsar and Manjri, at the Poonawalla Biotech Park, in all, spread out over ~100 acres. In the Netherlands, we have Bilthoven Biologicals, a bioengineering and pharmaceutical company to make injectable polio vaccine (IPV) on a 40-acre site, with the ability to make over 50 million doses of vaccines annually and where we also make the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine for bladder cancer treatment.

Though BCG is best known as a vaccine to prevent tuberculosis, it is also used to treat bladder cancer: BCG is given directly into the bladder which can trigger the immune system to get rid of cancer cells.

WHEN DID YOU DECIDE TO MAKE COVID-19 VACCINES?
The end of February, early March, last year we realised that this was going to be a pandemic and I think the first regulatory meeting we had was on 19th March with the Indian regulators in New Delhi, when we went ahead with the proposal of making the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine and Prof Adrian Hill of the University of Oxford joined the meeting virtually. This vaccine is called COVISHIELD in India.

Huge resources had to be put in by the Serum Institute and we took a huge risk (reports are that of the $800m (£579m) the Serum Institute needed, it invested $270m of its own money, set 1000 employees to work on the programme and raised the remaining funding from the Gates Foundation and various nations).

Nobody knew at that time whether we would get an effective vaccine and when. In June, AstraZeneca reached a licensing agreement with SII to supply one billion doses for low and middle-income countries, with a commitment to provide 400 million before the end of 2020. We started manufacturing of COVISHIELD at risk in August even before the full evidence had emerged that the vaccine would be effective. It was an emotional moment when we shipped the first COVISHIELD across India in January. We got authorisation for its emergency use from the World Health Organisation in February 2021. 

All vaccines contain an active component (the antigen) which generates a protective immune response, or the blueprint for making the active component. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is based on a Chimpanzee version of common cold-causing virus – a so called adenovirus – isolated from the stools of chimpanzees and genetically altered to cripple it, so that it cannot grow in the body, and further genetically altered to make the “spike” protein that this coronavirus uses to invade human cells.

The modified virus can only grow in HEK (human embryonic kidney) 293 cell lines, which are used in its manufacture.

Shortly, we expect to supply more than 400 million doses. We scaled up and manufactured very efficiently, to meet the global need. In addition, we are working with Novavax, which makes a different kind of COVID-19 vaccine, we call COVOVAX. 

The American company Novavax, based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, developed the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine, which consists of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein grown in insect cells. The gene for the virus spike protein is inserted into an insect virus, a baculovirus, which is grown in moth cells and then extracted and purified. The Novavax team takes the spike proteins and assembles them into nanoparticles that mimic the structure of the coronavirus but cannot replicate in the body.

To boost the immune response of the body, the company adds to the vaccine an adjuvant, called Matrix M, which is based on saponins, biochemicals found in plant species. Unlike the RNA vaccines, but like the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, the Novavax vaccine can be stored at refrigerator temperature, at 2°C to 8°C. Importantly, this vaccine has proven to be efficacious against two emerging variants of COVID-19 in the UK and South Africa.

Fortunately, Novavax is a company with whom we already work. They bought our plant which we had actually planned to make IPV, inactivated polio vaccine but now Novavax is using this plant to make the COVID-19 vaccine.  

We have signed a license agreement with Novavax for manufacturing and commercialization of the COVOVAX vaccine and hope to launch it in September.

Overall, for both vaccines it’s a pretty big operation. We have three fermenters to make 2000 litre quantities, and four fermenters each of which can hold 4000 litres. We use the human HEK 293 and insect cells to make the vaccines.  These are then purified and formulated in huge blending vessels. 

The final blended vaccines are then filled in vials in a state-of-the-art fill and finish facility. 

We do lot of testing during each manufacturing step, not only at our end, but also at several national control laboratories in India and other countries where the vaccine is supplied by SIIPL so there is a lot of quality assurance.

WHAT ELSE ARE YOU WORKING ON WITH NOVAVAX?
As I mentioned earlier, we have an excellent collaboration with Novavax for our Malaria vaccine. We use their Matrix M adjuvant, for our malaria vaccine, which will start phase three trials soon and is based on work at the University of Oxford and based on a protein particle called R21 that stimulate an immune response against the malaria parasite.

So that’s excellent news that we will end up with a very cost-effective large volume malaria vaccine available shortly, given that malaria remains a significant global health problem. We are into Phase three now with that vaccine. 

Researchers from the University of Oxford recently reported results from a Phase IIb trial of their R21/Matrix-M candidate malaria vaccine which demonstrated high-level efficacy of 77%. The results were highly promising because they are the first to meet the World Health Organization’s goal of a vaccine with at least 75% efficacy.

ARE YOU MAKING ANY MORE COVID-19 VACCINES?
We have other COVID-19 vaccines at an earlier stage of development, which consists of part of the COVID-19 spike protein – the receptor binding domain, RBD – delivered as a virus-like particle with the UK based company SpyBiotech; and a vaccine administered via the nose, with the American company Codagenix, which is designed to produce immunity against all SARS-CoV-2 proteins, not just the spike surface protein.

HOW CAN YOU SPEED UP VACCINE MANUFACTURE?
Today we use many more disposable technologies than a decade or more ago. Classically you would have to install stainless steel fermenters, for instance to grow the insect cells and infect them with baculovirus to make the protein for the Novavax vaccine. 

Now we have disposable technologies, where each stainless-steel fermenter has a disposable plastic lining. Disposable means there are stainless steel shells, but inside them there’s a plastic bag, with probes in an impeller that is driven by a magnetic stirring system. As soon as your work is done on that vaccine, you remove the bag and put in a new one, cutting the challenge of cleaning and validating and so on when you move on to another vaccine. Now you can cut the turnaround time and scale up more quickly.

The need to scale up has grown, along with the number of protocols and the need to deliver vaccines in the shortest possible time. Our chairman Cyrus Poonawalla and CEO Adar Poonawalla are setting up a huge new pandemic preparedness facility which will ensure that, in case of a next pandemic, the response rate will be faster and the supply rate can be increased and, in a few months, only we will be able to deliver billions of doses to the world saving millions of lives. This is a visionary effort which has been happening silently for a long time but now, due to COVID, people are coming to know about it. 

The 500,000 square foot plant, which will include research and development labs, should be able to quickly change from vaccine technology to technology so we can make several billion doses of a product in the shortest possible time. So that visionary effort is already well advanced.

DO YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO MAKE THE COVID-19 VACCINES IN INDIA?
No, we depend on an international supply chain, with the majority coming from Europe and the US.

ARE YOUR PREPARING FOR NEW STRAINS OF COVID-19?
Yes, we are preparing for new strains. It is a challenge for all humanity that the virus is mutating and one must understand this and come out with a newer and newer version of vaccines before a new strain takes over. 

Which strain of SARS-CoV-2 we have to target with a vaccine is the million-dollar question, of course. Nobody knows if it will be one strain, such as the South African strain, the newly emerging variants in India (these have been detected by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics, INSACOG) , or if we need a cocktail to be a Ram baan (the unerring arrow was the weapon of choice for the Hindu deity Rama). I doubt there will be a one stop solution – we will probably need a cocktail.

As more people are vaccinated, there will be pressure on the virus to evolve new tactics to evade the immune system. I think it is going to take time to really understand what would be the best solution for disease elimination. 

TELL ME ABOUT INDIA’S “VACCINE MAITRI” (VACCINE FRIENDSHIP) PROGRAMME?
This is a really nice initiative by Government of India. Maitri is a classical Indian word for benevolence and goodwill, not just me and my house or me and my family but the whole world. Our prime minister, based on that vision, has provided Indian made vaccines since January of this year, something like 60 million COVID vaccine doses to over 70 nations.

We are also committed to COVAX, backed by by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), the Vaccine Alliance Gavi and the World Health Organization with UNICEF to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.

DO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) RIGHTS RELATED TO COVID-19 HINDER VACCINATION EFFORTS?
As a company, we do not have any kind of hesitation about respecting IP, because that’s important and encourages innovation.  But our chief executive, Adar Poonawalla, believes that the pandemic should prompt a reassessment of patent and intellectual property laws that limit access of low income countries to vaccines.

By one estimate, poorer nations — which account for 80% of the global population — so far have access to less than one-third of the available vaccines. This week the United States announced that it backs a waiver on vaccine patents to boost supplies. However, even if patents did not apply, procuring vaccine ingredients, setting up factories, training people and so on will take some time.

WHAT HAS BEEN THE MAIN LESSON OF THE PANDEMIC?
This pandemic has taught humanity two important lessons: don’t shy away from vaccination, because prevention is better than cure. And people have come to appreciate the importance of institutions such as the Serum Institute of India where, thanks to the vision of Dr Cyrus Poonawalla, there is the infrastructure to deliver billions of doses in a short time. In fact, the chairman of the World Bank recently said that India is lucky to have the Serum Institute. We have contributed to saving millions of lives and our journey continues.

HOW CAN I FIND OUR MORE?
The latest picture of how far the pandemic has spread can be seen on the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center or Robert Koch-Institute.

Everyone has seen scenarios like corona testing, containment zone, safe home, quarantine, mask, sanitiser, PPE kits, rushing of ambulances, etc. This covid-19 pandemic has impacted the severe lockdown of industries and offices. This covid-19 has impacted a lot of Jobs in India, businesses and other industries.

Migration of labourers
During the lockdown, the job loser labourers migrated to their villages with hungry children, women, and elderly family members. The migrating labourers were lucky to get any public transport used it. Millions of migrant labourers including their families took to the street for their villages. These labourers were facing unbearable pain for crossing over hundreds of kilometres on feet along with national highways. Police had restricted their entry into their village and kept them wherever they find the place. 

Unemployment rate increased
This Covid-19 pandemic has not only migrated the labourers and employees to their native places but also many lost their jobs. During this pandemic, many people lost their jobs and many people have to face salary reductions. During this COVID 19 pandemic situation, day by day scaring distress of humankind were also seen.
However, the coronavirus compelled people to set up oxygen plants at various hospitals. Several patients have died due to a shortage of beds, medicines, PPE kits and oxygen. However, during this situation, the same flights from foreign countries were used for importing oxygen cylinders, ventilators, testing kits, PPEs, medicines and other vaccines.
This covid-19 has adverse impacts on daily life and led to an increase in prices of groceries and other daily needs. Several state government officers were compelled to lockdown during the pandemic. The retail prices of diesel and petrol rose during a pandemic, and this led to an increase in the prices of transportation and other raw materials.
India's unemployment rose during this pandemic, which is more than in previous years. However, this pandemic allowed Remote Working and new areas of technological fields rose during this situation. During the lockdown, severe restrictions were placed on the movement of citizens, and economic activities were restricted related to essential goods and services. Placement in India was stopped for many, and some gave new roles.
During this pandemic situation, the number of deaths rose to a level which is more than in previous years. However, with the second wave of covid-19, it gave people the to prepare for the worse condition adequately. However, import of life-saving devices and medicines were imported in quantities to fight against the second wave of covid-19. The covid-19 altered the landscape of the country’s employment sector. However, among the various sectors, the aviation, hospitality and tourism industry was badly affected due to lockdown. Indians were forced to stay inside their home and employees were left from employment without pay. However, the healthcare and education industry saw a great impact from the lockdown.
It was estimated that 20 million people work in the tourism industry and many employees were hit worse. However, apart from this small restaurant and the hotel industry was badly hit. The Indian hospitality industry is $10 billion, and it is estimated to employ 35 million people. However, the nexus industry was the automobile industry that was badly hit by removing drivers.       
Due to the pandemic situation, online grocery shopping and e-learning have increased, and offline shops have suffered a lot. It is also estimated that companies like Ola, Uber, Swiggy, Zomato, Flipkart and Amazon were the big players who were benefitted during this worst situation. Like a coin has two sides, as many lost their jobs and new roles were started to emerge due to remote working. However, new Jobs were created in the healthcare sector. Medical and healthcare industries saw the recovery of jobs in the second wave of the pandemic.
We can conclude that during lockdown e-learning industry rose to great heights. Despite the shutting of schools and colleges online classes and Edu-tech companies gained the most benefit during this pandemic. Byju turned out to be the second most world’s company to gain the most during this worst situation. It was also observed that apart from edtech start-ups, e-commerce platforms, health care companies and electric mobility companies were the leading sectors to hire the employees most. So even after the worst situation, people lost their jobs, but after complete vaccination, all the sectors are coming back on track.",1680546652308job.jpg,Consequences of Covid-19 on Employment,2023-04-03T18:30:53.396Z,Stanley
0,642b1efa48db562e66543ebc,[],2023-04-03T18:46:18.853Z,"The impact of COVID-19 worldwide has been profound to say the least. From Africa and Europe to Asia and the Americas, almost no continent has been spared of its wrath. If we talk about the negative impact of Coronavirus, the list is long – lakhs of casualties till now, millions of infected people and counting, sudden curfews and long lockdowns, loss of livelihoods, loss of economy, social anxiety and the medical / healthcare system constantly battling against the pandemic, even given their constraints. 

US, Brazil and India are the three countries where the most number of Coronavirus cases have been found till now. According to a recent data point, around 65,000 fresh COVID-19 cases have been detected in just a single day in India. However, the cumulative death toll is under control and recovery rate is quite good too. The point of worry is – the pandemic doesn’t seem to be slowing down, leaving countries and their economies dependent on pro-active planning and some tough decision making. Let’s understand in detail the impact of COVID-19 on Indian economy:

Disruption in supply chains: India had been importing 45% of its electronics from China alone. If we talk about machinery and organic chemicals, the statistics are again high. Around 33% of machinery and 40% of organic chemicals used to be imported from China. Even in automotive parts and fertilizers, China’s contribution was more than 25%. The most astonishing fact is that more than 90% mobile phones came from China to India and around 75% of pharmaceutical ingredients were sourced from there. With the outbreak of Coronavirus, India has stopped importing most of these goods. This development has disrupted the supply chain and broken-down different levels of supplier networks. A lot of businessmen have received a strong set back in their trading deals.
Fall in household income and marketing expense: In response to the turmoil of Coronavirus, RBI and the Government of India have come up with concrete steps, such as reduction in repo rate, boost to liquidity in the system and regulatory relaxation by extending moratorium. Sluggish businesses, payments deferrals, and subsided loan growth have impaired the health of the economy. Deceleration of GDP growth, reduction in discretionary expenses and CAPEX have resulted into fall in marketing spends and household incomes. However, it is expected that reduced oil prices and healthy balance sheets would revive growth once the lockdown gets completely ended.
Loss in hospitality and travel industry: The pandemic has left a debilitating impact on India’s tourism sector, with an overall loss of around Rs 5 lakh crore. Around 4-5 crore people hitherto working in this sector have lost their jobs. According to estimates by CII, the most organized sectors of the industry – tour operators, travel agencies, and branded hotels have been hit the hardest, with an estimated loss of around Rs 1.6 lakh crore. Though domestic flights have been started, people are avoiding travel through aviation, which has again brought huge losses to the industry. Even hotels and motels are suffering from down period. Average hotel occupancy has dropped by over 45%. In fact, revenue per available room has witness a significant decline of 31%-36%.
Worst losses in stock market: Ever since COVID-19 has arrived, stock market has seen a major fall. Both BSE Sensex and Nifty have fallen down by around 38%. From the start of the year, the total market cap has lost a staggering 27%. Certain sectors such as hospitality, tourism and entertainment have been adversely impacted. Stocks of such companies have dropped by over 40%. On 23rd March 2020, stock markets in India had stooped to record lows.
A few gains through PPE kit and ventilator exports: In collaboration with the government, India’s capacity to manufacture PPE kits has increased. According to a recent report, the country is producing around 6 lakh personal protective equipment (PPE) kits per day. We have also improved on our nation-wide capacity to produce ventilators and are also exporting a portion of them.
Growth of e-learning programs: Since March 2020, millions of youngsters in India have got affected due to COVID-19. The pandemic has brought major losses to most of the industries. However, it has triggered a good 25% hike in the e-learning industry. Digital initiatives taken by the government comprise of the DIKSHA portal that serves as nation-wide digital education infrastructure, especially for teachers. And, ‘e-Pathshala’ has arranged web resources for students, researchers, parents and educators in rural areas.
Disturbance in miscellaneous industries: Apparel and textile industries have been hit badly due to raw material unavailability, shortage in labor supply, restricted movement of people, and purchasing inability. In fact, auto sector (auto parts and automobile) is continuously facing challenges on account of falling income levels and lack of demand. Talking about construction / real estate industry, there is a lack of sales and high-interest payments.
Undoubtedly, the outbreak of COVID-19 has hit economies hard the world across. For India too, it’s a challenging situation. Extended lockdown and fear of / restrictions on movement have severely impacted our economy. At the same time, a silver lining is that a lot of infected people are recovering quickly. Our medical teams are also putting considerable efforts to develop a vaccine. We all need to be positive, follow precautions and stay safe. Like everything else, this too shall pass and once again, with everyone’s efforts, our economy will see a boom",1680547577818covid-income.jpg,Did the COVID-19 pandemic impact India's income distribution?,2023-04-03T18:46:18.853Z,Stanley
0,642b1fd548db562e66543ebf,[],2023-04-03T18:49:57.029Z,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present considerable public health challenges in the United States and around the globe. One of the most puzzling is why many people who get over an initial and often relatively mild COVID illness later develop new and potentially debilitating symptoms. These symptoms run the gamut including fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, anxiety, and gastrointestinal trouble.

People understandably want answers to help them manage this complex condition referred to as Long COVID syndrome. But because Long COVID is so variable from person to person, it’s extremely difficult to work backwards and determine what these people had in common that might have made them susceptible to Long COVID. The variability also makes it difficult to identify all those who have Long COVID, whether they realize it or not. But a recent study, published in the journal Lancet Digital Health, shows that a well-trained computer and its artificial intelligence can help.

Researchers found that computers, after scanning thousands of electronic health records (EHRs) from people with Long COVID, could reliably make the call. The results, though still preliminary and in need of further validation, point the way to developing a fast, easy-to-use computer algorithm to help determine whether a person with a positive COVID test is likely to battle Long COVID.

In this groundbreaking study, NIH-supported researchers led by Emily Pfaff, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and Melissa Haendel, the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, relied on machine learning. In machine learning, a computer sifts through vast amounts of data to look for patterns. One reason machine learning is so powerful is that it doesn’t require humans to tell the computer which features it should look for. As such, machine learning can pick up on subtle patterns that people would otherwise miss.

In this case, Pfaff, Haendel, and team decided to “train” their computer on EHRs from people who had reported a COVID-19 infection. (The records are de-identified to protect patient privacy.) The researchers found just what they needed in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a national, publicly available data resource sponsored by NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. It is part of NIH’s Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) initiative, which aims to improve understanding of Long COVID.

The researchers defined a group of more than 1.5 million adults in N3C who either had been diagnosed with COVID-19 or had a record of a positive COVID-19 test at least 90 days prior. Next, they examined common features, including any doctor visits, diagnoses, or medications, from the group’s roughly 100,000 adults.

They fed that EHR data into a computer, along with health information from almost 600 patients who’d been seen at a Long COVID clinic. They developed three machine learning models: one to identify potential long COVID patients across the whole dataset and two others that focused separately on people who had or hadn’t been hospitalized.

All three models proved effective for identifying people with potential Long-COVID. Each of the models had an 85 percent or better discrimination threshold, indicating they are highly accurate. That’s important because, once researchers can identify those with Long COVID in a large database of people such as N3C, they can begin to ask and answer many critical questions about any differences in an individual’s risk factors or treatment that might explain why some get Long COVID and others don’t.

This new study is also an excellent example of N3C’s goal to assemble data from EHRs that enable researchers around the world to get rapid answers and seek effective interventions for COVID-19, including its long-term health effects. It’s also made important progress toward the urgent goal of the RECOVER initiative to identify people with or at risk for Long COVID who may be eligible to participate in clinical trials of promising new treatment approaches.

Long COVID remains a puzzling public health challenge. Another recent NIH study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine set out to identify people with symptoms of Long COVID, most of whom had recovered from mild-to-moderate COVID-19 [2]. More than half had signs of Long COVID. But, despite extensive testing, the NIH researchers were unable to pinpoint any underlying cause of the Long COVID symptoms in most cases.",1680547796023AI-and-long-covid2-1536x864.jpg,Using AI to Advance Understanding of Long COVID Syndrome,2023-04-03T18:49:57.029Z,Stanley

The lockdown has resulted in a reduction in economic values and a lack of income, adding to the severity of the situation. The situational pressure has increased, and many people have been experiencing financial troubles, necessitating dependable financial assistance to get through emergencies and uncertainties. Therefore, it is important to choose proper covid-19 insurance policy Several life and health insurance firms have established COVID-19 insurance coverage or are providing a COVID-19 top-up with their current plans, recognizing the necessity of the hour. However, not all health insurance plans are worth your time and effort, and you can only get the finest COVID insurance policy for you and your family if you make an informed decision.

As the COVID-19 situation worsens across the country, the financial crisis worsens, with falling stock markets and employment losses, exacerbating the whole scenario. Furthermore, India’s low insurance penetration could generate more significant problems because the entire financial burden would rest on the families of persons who delayed purchasing timely insurance plans. Only a comprehensive insurance policy can save you in demanding and unprecedented times.

So, should you purchase specialized health insurance for Covid 19 or rely on an existing term health insurance policy? We recommend that you get both!

While specialized covid health insurance can help cover hospitalization and other costs, a Term Plan with Corona coverage would be advantageous in the event of an unexpected event. In the event of a misfortune, most term plans provide a lump sum to the insured’s family, guaranteeing that their expenses are met.

Provider credibility
When looking for the finest covid 19 health insurance policy, the first and most crucial factor to consider is the insurance provider’s credibility. Various firms offer competitive prices and insurance advantages, but not all areas prompt in approving claims.  At Aditya Birla Group, we provide easy claim solutions with affordable premium rates. 

It is better if you know the company’s claim settlement ratio and solvency ratio. The claims settlement or paid ratio is the percentage of total claims filed compared to claims paid out. On the other hand, the solvency ratio indicates if the corporation is in a strong financial position to pay off the claims, which is especially important during COVID-19 when several claims are filed simultaneously.

We have the Corona Kavach policy that is aimed at offering protection against high-expenses of Covid-19. Corona has become like an epidemic that can affect almost anyone. With our affordable premium solutions, we aim at offering you the perk of filing claims accordingly. 

A sufficient quantity of coverage
Different insurance policies provide sum assured, ranging from Rs.20,000 to Rs.2 lakhs. However, when choosing the best covid health insurance plans, you must consider whether the coverage is adequate to meet your demands and support your family if the disease worsens and something unpleasant occurs. 

This is applicable from a specific type of infection and should offer a 360-degree coverage for all covid variants, including Omicron and its likes. Therefore, we introduce plans that are applicable for all the variants with a faster delivery timeline. The Corona Kavach policy offers a flexibility of premium from Rs 50,000 to 5 lacs. The insured sum is applicable for all individuals in the family members. 

Affordability of premiums
Purchasing covid 19 health insurance, particularly for people living in high-risk locations has become crucial. Still, the current economic situation has impacted everyone’s income stream, making buying a policy with affordable costs even more crucial. Corona Kavach’s premium starts as low as Rs 2,486 per annum that covers all hospital expenses. 

Look for a plan that strikes a good balance between the level of coverage and the cost of the premiums. You can compare all our plans to get the best deals. 

Easy application and claim process
Another factor to consider when purchasing covid health insurance is the ease of application and claim processing. Read the company’s policies carefully to ensure that the claim process is quick and painless, so your family doesn’t have to dash from one end of the country to the other filing insurance claims. Our company policies are available in the website itself to maintain transparency with our audience. 

Customer service
To find the finest COVID-19 insurance, look for a company with a good track record of customer service. To ensure that their customer service is up to par, conduct research and speak with corporate management. In a pandemic, the goal is to connect with a provider who provides exceptional customer service and quickly resolves complaints. We are available 24*7 for our customers. You can consider reaching out to us via Whatsapp for exclusive services. 


Final Thoughts

The Covid-19 insurance policy has a wide range of health insurance policies aimed at helping our customers. Whether you need a standalone policy or top-up plan, our agents will offer you guidance on the same. Make sure to compare all the plans before determining what is the best. You don’t need any medical reports to file for this policy as we cover everything in it. Apart from the hospitalization treatment, you can also benefit from our in-home treatment coverages.

Older adults are receiving postcards from the National Residential Improvement Association addressed to ""resident"" offering to help secure a grant for home repairs. This is not a government program and the company does not currently have a business license.

Here are some basic steps that can help you avoid these schemes: 
• DO NOT TRUST ANY unexpected calls or visitors offering coronavirus tests, supplies, or grants;
-BE CAUTIOUS AND SKEPTICAL of all unsolicited requests of personal information over the telephone, like your Medicare number, Social Security number or banking information;
• IGNORE ANY AND ALL social media offers or advertisements for coronavirus testing or treatments or messages or posts from people excited to share the thousands of dollars they claim to have received from an organization that secures grants for homeowners;
• Remember that ONLY a physician or trusted health care provider should assess your condition and approve requests for COVID-19 testing;
• NEVER PAY a fee to a company that says it will help you get a grant;
-•Only use local contractors with validated references to do work in your home.
